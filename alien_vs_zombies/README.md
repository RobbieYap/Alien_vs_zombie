# Alien vs. Zombie

Please introduce the game here.

Alien vs Zombie is a 2D turn base strategic game, where you as the player play as the main hero the Alien
and your mission is to defeat all the zombies. The alien will spawn on the middle of the board and you have to 
search around to find helpful resources to defeat all the zombies on the board. Not only that, you are not the only
one that can move and attack. So beware of the zombies and movements because its only a matter of time before the 
zombies come and get you.
